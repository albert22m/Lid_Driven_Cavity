# Lid-Driven Cavity Flow Simulation

This project numerically solves the **2D lid-driven cavity flow** using the **finite difference method**, with **RK3/RK4 (Runge-Kutta 3rd/4th order)** for time integration and a **projection method** to enforce incompressibility through the pressure Poisson equation.

## Overview

The lid-driven cavity problem is a classic benchmark problem in computational fluid dynamics (CFD). It involves a square cavity where the top lid moves with a constant velocity, while all other walls remain stationary. The goal is to solve the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations to obtain the velocity and pressure fields.

### Key Features

- Finite difference discretization
- RK3/RK4 for time integration of intermediate velocities
- Projection method for incompressible flow
- Numba-accelerated performance
- NPZ binary file format for efficient data saving
- Visualization using Matplotlib
- Animated GIF creation of the velocity field

## Mathematical Formulation

### Equations Solved

- **Momentum Equation (Intermediate velocity)**
  
  $$\frac{\partial \vec{u}}{\partial t} + (\vec{u} \cdot \nabla)\vec{u} = -\nabla p + \nu \nabla^2 \vec{u}$$

- **Continuity Equation (Incompressibility Constraint)**

  $$\nabla \cdot \vec{u} = 0$$

- **Projection Method**
  
  Intermediate velocity is projected onto a divergence-free space by solving the **Pressure Poisson Equation**:

  $$\nabla^2 p = \frac{\rho}{\Delta t} \nabla \cdot \vec{u}^*$$

### Boundary Conditions

- Top wall: $(u = 1)$, $( v = 0)$ (moving lid)
- Other walls: $(u = 0)$, $(v = 0)$
